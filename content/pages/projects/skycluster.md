## The Sky Cluster

We developed The Sky Cluster, a Flutter cross-plataform app that allows users to experience a starry night from an exoplanet of their choice, learn about the planet and create unique constellations. Its importance relies on the complexity of most databases that makes the information inaccesible for most people. The Sky Cluster simplifies NASA's open-coded databases and transforms them into a friendly interface, powering dynamic learning and limitless curiosity, useful for students as well as specialists. In addition, the possibility of drawing new constellations incites imagination and creativity.

### Challenge:

## 2024 NASA Space Apps: Exosky!

What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions? The list of 5500+ exoplanets at the NASA Exoplanet Archive can be combined with the latest star catalogs to translate the location and brightness of millions or even billions of stars to another perspective. From that perspective, anyone could use their imagination to draw constellations, much like our ancestors did on Earth thousands of years ago. Your challenge is to develop an app or interface for students that allows them to choose an exoplanet and then either display an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on a computer or virtual reality display, where they can draw and name constellations.
