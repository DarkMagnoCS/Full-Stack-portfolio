InSight: Mars Weather Service API
NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth
plain near Mars’ equator. Please note that there are sometimes problems with the sensors on Mars that result in missing data! If you see a long gap, a search
result may bring up more information on whether it is a long-lasting problem. Summaries of these data are available at https\://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/.
This API provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last seven available Sols (Martian Days). As more data from a particular Sol are downlinked from the
spacecraft (sometimes several days later), these values are recalculated, and consequently may change as more data are received on Earth. Additionally,
please note that wind and other sensor data may not exist for certain date ranges. You can check out https\://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/ and scroll down to
the 'seasonal weather report' you'll see the gaps where no data exists for some sensors
